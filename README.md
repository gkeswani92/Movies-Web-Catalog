# Movies-Web-Catalog

This is a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch their trailers. 

<b>Requirements</b>
Python 2.7

<b>How to run the project?</b>

To run the project, you need to open and run the entertainment_center.py file. This will open up a new tab in the browser
if the browser was already open or will open one if not. 

Running the entertainment_center.py also creates a fresh_tomatoes.html file in the same directory. This file can be used at 
at any point of time to view the movie trailers without running the entertainment_center.py file again.
